do you smoke or drink? can you try taking sudafed, tylenol, and zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? i am sure that will make you feel better. avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. keep the ac to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. drink plenty of water and warm fluids. avoid eating out, partying. avoid unnecessary travel. you need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised. lastly, where are you currently? your place of residence and country? is it a corona endemic country? did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient? can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?', 'thank you doctor, i woke up this morning, i had trouble sleeping being worried, but i got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up. so far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. i only hear minor coughs the past week or so. thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. i fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days. i will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. yes, i will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. and school is online. i recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. i might not need ac unless really hot. i will be staying home for the next month at least. my chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe i did not get enough sleep. i stay in san francisco ca, united states, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. no severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition. so, last week i have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. any recommendations? any foods or drinks that can help?', 'hi, you have got it right. follow all the precautions. you will be alright soon. try getting a good sleep tonight. i heard about the cases in sf. my brother was supposed to fly there from india for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus. yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. it has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). but yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils). the tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which i guess, in you, must be slightly big. the pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection. now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not corona). they usually get better with time and supportive treatment. traditional indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. tea makes a good addition i guess. sudafed and zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. tylenol

medicine. on monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 am, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and i described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like gerd, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. he asked have you tried stronger antacids like pepcid or zantac? i said no. then doctor asked me to try pepcid and tell me how it goes. tuesday and wednesday march 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot,

haven't really been doing it. used to a lot years ago, now barely. since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. after this point high school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. when i was younger (elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through. one doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it. so, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out
